# Lab Exercises

The following exercises will present you with a problem and give you the building blocks to solve it, but won't provide a solution.

I recommend reading the full exercise before jumping into the code. This will help you understand the scope of the exercise and can answer some questions that you otherwise might get stuck on.

The documentation linked in each exercise should provide everything you need to know, but it may take some time to read and make sense of everything. Work through the problem on your own for a bit, but feel free to ask your colleagues or the lab organizer for help to keep you moving along smoothly.
