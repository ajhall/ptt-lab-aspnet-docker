# BONUS ZONE

Now you know how to build a ASP&#46;NET Core app, run it on your computer, and prepare a build for your users.

You're still at the mercy of the environment your user chooses to run it in, though. Maybe you want to use a brand-new version of .NET Core that hasn't been installed on the server you're running on, for example, and your app just won't start up unless they install the new runtime.

Sounds like a job for Docker!
