# Look around

Open your work folder in Visual Studio Code to see your whole project. Before you open a new window to find your project, though, try this command-line trick.

You can open VS Code with the `code` command, which takes a file or folder path as its first argument. On the command line, you can specify the current folder by just typing a dot (`.`). That means you can run `code .` to quickly open your project in VS Code.

```powershell
code .
```

Look around in your project to see the files that were created by this template.

## What are these files?

Your folder structure should look something like this.

```text
│   appsettings.Development.json
│   appsettings.json
│   Program.cs
│   Startup.cs
│   WebAPI.csproj
│
├───Controllers
│       ValuesController.cs
│
├───obj
│       project.assets.json
│       WebAPI.csproj.nuget.cache
│       WebAPI.csproj.nuget.g.props
│       WebAPI.csproj.nuget.g.targets
│
├───Properties
│       launchSettings.json
│
└───wwwroot
```

### `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json`

Configuration files that your app can read from. This lets you change your configuration easily without relying on code changes or the Windows registry.

ASP&#46;NET Core provides [classes to read from these files automatically](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-2.1#json-configuration-provider). You can provide multiple configuration files named as `appsettings.<Environment>.json` to load a specific one based on your current.

The `<Environment>` value is read from the [`ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable](https://andrewlock.net/how-to-set-the-hosting-environment-in-asp-net-core/). If you don't specify your environment explicitly, it will default to "Production".

### `Program.cs`

The entry point to your app. It starts the ASP&#46;NET Core web server and tells it to use your `Startup` class for configuration.

You can configure your web host in detail if you choose to, but the [defaults provided by CreateDefaultBuilder](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/web-host?view=aspnetcore-2.1#set-up-a-host) provide a solid set of best practices.

It may look like there's not much going on in `Program.cs`, but this single line of code applies the default configuration and hides quite a bit of complexity.

```csharp
WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
```

### `Startup.cs`

Contains two methods (`Configure` and `ConfigureServices`) that get called automatically by ASP&#46;NET Core when your app starts up. These configure your app's built-in web server.

### `WebAPI.csproj`

Defines metadata about your project and how the project gets compiled and published.

### `Controllers/ValuesController.cs`

A basic shell of an [ASP.NET Model-View-Controller (MVC) Controller](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/controllers-and-routing/aspnet-mvc-controllers-overview-cs). Once your app is started up, you'll be able to trigger these routes by going to the path based on the controller name and function name.

The `[Route("api/[controller]")]` attribute at the top of the class specifies that the route to this controller is `/api/Values`, so you can trigger these routes by accessing `/api/Values`, `/api/Values/1`, and so on.

### `obj/*`

These are automatically generated by the `dotnet` tool. You don't need to edit these, and they can be added to your `.gitignore` file so they won't be included in source control.

### `Properties/launchSettings.json`

This sets up different launch configurations for your app. By default, `dotnet run` will launch your application using the first profile it finds in this file that has `"commandName": "Project"` specified.

### `wwwroot`

This folder holds any static web content you might need to serve with your app. We won't be using it in this lab.
